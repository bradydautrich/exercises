        The Shakers broke off from the Quakers in the mid-18th century.</p>
    <p>Some 89% of Quakers worldwide belong to evangelical and programmed branches[9] that hold services with singing and a prepared Bible message coordinated by a pastor. Some 11% practice waiting worship or unprogrammed worship (commonly Meeting for Worship),[10] where the unplanned order of service is mainly silent and may include unprepared vocal ministry from those present. Some meetings of both types have Recorded Ministers present, Friends recognised for their gift of vocal ministry.[11]</p>
