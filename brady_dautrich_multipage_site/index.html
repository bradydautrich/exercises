            Plainfield is a city in Union County, in the U.S. state of <a href="new jersey/index.html">New Jersey</a>. Nicknamed "The Queen City,",[1] it serves as both a regional hub for Central New Jersey and a bedroom suburb of the New York Metropolitan area, located in the Raritan Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the city's population, majority Latino for the first time, was 54,586.[11][12] This was an increase of 4,778 (+9.6%) from the 2010 census count of 49,808,[21][22] which in turn reflected an increase of 1,979 (+4.1%) from the 47,829 counted in the 2000 census.[23] In 2022, the Census Bureau estimated the city's population to be 54,513.[14]>

            Plainfield was settled in 1684 by <a href="Quakers/index.html">Quakers</a>,[27] and incorporated as a city in 1869. Formerly a bedroom suburb in the New York metropolitan area, it has become the urban center of 10 closely allied municipalities, with diversified industries, including printing and the manufacture of chemicals, clothing, electronic equipment, and vehicular parts. Among the several 18th-century buildings remaining are a Friends' meetinghouse (1788),[28] the Martine house (1717), and the Nathaniel Drake House (1746), known as George Washington's headquarters during the Battle of Short Hills in June 1777.[29][30] Nearby Washington Rock is a prominent point of the Watchung Mountains and is reputed to be the vantage point from which Washington watched British troop movements.[31][32]
